Exploring the Complexity of the English Language

Activity 1 – Read the text below

Language is a fascinating and complex system that we use every day to communicate with others. To help us
understand this complexity, we turn to the field of linguistics. Linguistics is the systematic study of language
and its structure. It helps us break down language into different parts so we can understand how it works and
how we use it.

In simple terms, linguistics is about understanding everything related to language, from the sounds we make to
express words, to the way we use language in different social contexts. It's a way to uncover how language
shapes our thoughts, cultures, and identities.

The study of linguistics is divided into three main areas: Sounds, Structure, and Meaning.

Let's take a closer look at each of these areas:

Sounds
Phonetics: Phonetics is about the actual sounds we make when we talk. Think about how your mouth
moves and what happens with your voice when you say different sounds, like the “p” sound
versus the “b” sound. For example, "pat" and "bat" start with different sounds – phonetics
helps us understand how we make these different sounds.
Phonology: Phonology is about how sounds function within particular languages or language systems. It
looks at how sounds interact with each other and the rules that guide them. In English, "ng"
makes a different sound than "n" + "g" together, like in "sing" vs. "snag".

Structure
Morphology: Morphology is the study of words and how they’re formed. It looks at how bits of words (called
"morphemes") are put together to make meaning. For instance, "unhappiness" has three parts:
"un-" (not), "happy" (a base word), and "-ness" (a state of) – each part is a morpheme.

Syntax: Syntax is about how we arrange words into sentences in a way that makes sense. It’s like
figuring out the proper order to put words so we understand each other. "The cat chased the
mouse" makes sense, but "Mouse the cat chased the" doesn't – syntax helps us understand
why.

Meaning
Semantics: Semantics deals with meaning in language. It's about how words and sentences convey what
we want to say. The word "bank" can mean the side of a river or a place to keep money –
semantics helps us understand these different meanings.
Pragmatics: Pragmatics is about how context influences the way we interpret what someone is saying. If
someone says "Can you pass the salt?" in a dining setting, pragmatics helps us understand that
it’s a request, not just a question about our ability.

Here is a table that summarises these main areas of linguistics:

```

By understanding these areas, you will gain a deeper insight into how language works and how you can use
English more effectively. We will explore each of these areas together, making learning fun and engaging!

Introduction to Syllable Structures, Phonetics, and Phonology
Mastering a new language, especially English, involves understanding its sounds, structures, and meanings. To
build a strong foundation, we start with the basics: syllable structures, phonetics, and phonology. These
elements are crucial because they form the building blocks of pronunciation and help us speak clearly and
accurately.

To illustrate the importance of understanding syllable structures, let’s consider the pronunciation of the words
'late' in English and 'leite' in Portuguese. While these words are almost identical phonetically, they are spelled
differently and exhibit one syllable in English and two syllables in Portuguese. The tendency of Portuguese
learners, across all language levels, is to split the word 'late' in English into two syllables.

This tendency reveals that Portuguese learners often rely on a vowel sound to articulate a consonant clearly. In
Portuguese, consonant sounds are typically followed, or preceded, by a vowel, which helps in their
pronunciation. This aspect of the Portuguese phonetic system can present a challenge when learning English,
where consonants can appear in clusters without intervening vowels or at the end of words without being
followed by a vowel sound.

Basic Organization of Sounds in Speech
To understand how we speak, let's break down the sounds into smaller parts. This will help us see how words
are made and how we can pronounce them correctly.

Speech is Made of Syllables:
When we speak, we say words that are made up of smaller parts called syllables.
A syllable is like a beat in a word. For example, "cake" has one syllable, and "chocolate" has three syllables
(choc-late).

Each Syllable Has a Vowel Sound:
Every syllable must have one vowel sound. This is the main sound you hear in the syllable.
Sometimes a syllable has other sounds around the vowel, like consonants, but it always has at least one vowel
sound. This is the core of the syllable.
− Focus on Sounds, Not Letters: Spelling can be misleading because some vowel letters are silent (e.g.,
"love" /lʌv/).

It's essential for Portuguese learners to understand and recognise the different syllable structures in English,
along with the distinction between short and long vowel sounds.

Closed Syllables:
In closed syllables, a syllable ends with a consonant, and the vowel sound is shortened.
Example: In the word 'cat,' the 'a' is a short sound, as opposed to the longer 'ai' sound in 'baby.'

Open Syllables:

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In open syllables, which end with a vowel, the vowel sound is elongated.
Example: In the word 'he,' the 'e' is pronounced as a long vowel, different from the short /e/ in the closed
syllable of 'bed.'

Silent 'e' Syllables:
In words like 'late,' the 'e' at the end is silent, but it makes the previous vowel sound longer.

| Vowels | A | E | I | O | U | Y |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Short Vowel Sounds | /æ/|/ɛ/|/ɪ/|/ɒ/|/ʌ/ + /ʊ/|/ɪ/|
| Closed |cat[k |bed[bɛd] | sit[sɪt] | hot [hɒt] | but[bʌt]| gym[dʒɪm] |
|Syllables |æt] | | | | put[pʊt] |
|Long Vowel
